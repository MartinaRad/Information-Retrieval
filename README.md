This is a project done by a team of five people for Information Retrieval in OvGU (Magdeburg, Germany).

Task:
- Design and program a search engine that also shows a representative graphical image from each topic that is listed in the results. 

- Create a search result snippet and display it in the GUI alongwith the document title.

- Extract the matching keywords from the crawled dataset and highlight them in the searchresult snippet.

- For each result (topic) in the result list (e.g. 10 results) in addition to therepresentative image also the corresponding (extracted) keywords have to be visualized.



For this task you need to have a folder with already downloaded Wikipedia pages (done with a Python code, that is not uploaded in this Git).

The back-end is done with Apache Lucene.
The front-end is done on Java Swing.
